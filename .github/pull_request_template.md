### About Commit Messages

We use semantic versioning to automate our release process. While not required, using semantic commit messages helps us maintain a clear changelog:

```
type: concise description of your change

Examples:
feat: add support for Google Bard
perf: improve search response time
```

Common types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
